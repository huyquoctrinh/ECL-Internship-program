This is the EEG data extract module:

# Usage :green_heart::

First, you should create the folder name for save data with name ``` <./folder_name/> ```

Then update to 2 parameters in the ```main.py``` file to run:
 
 - ```src``` : is the source dir to the data
 
 - ``` dst```: is the final data saving directory
 
 After that, run ```main.py``` to execute and extract data.
 
 Hope you can do it well :wink:
